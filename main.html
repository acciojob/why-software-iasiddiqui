		Why I want to become a developer?
	</h1>
	<p>
		I want to become a developer because it allows me to combine creativity and problem-solving to build solutions that can make a real impact. The dynamic nature of technology excites me, as it offers endless opportunities to learn and grow. I’m drawn to the idea of crafting applications and tools that not only solve problems but also improve lives, whether through innovation or efficiency. Becoming a developer means being at the forefront of change, and I’m eager to contribute to shaping the future through technology.
